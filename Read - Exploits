Exploit Kits: are more comprehensive tools that contain a collection of exploits. These kits scan devices for different kinds of software vulnerabilities and, if any are detected, deploy additional malware to further infect a device.  they can distribute malware or perform other malicious activities

Risk: (Threat) which may materialize, if someone decides to take advantage of a vulnerability and exploit it.

Payloads: basically define an action that we want to perform after we exploit a vulnerability. For instance

Execute a code
Spawn a reverse shell
Create a backdoor
Create a user 
Or anything we want 

Shellcodes belongs to the area of binary exploitation. A shellcode is basically a binary form of a payload – a piece of code defining the action (instructions) that we want to execute during the exploitation. shellcode is written in a machine code that is appropriate to the target processor architecture and the operating system. For instance:

      x86 / Windows Dalvik / Android

Here’s an example of the msfvenom utility from Metasploit, which can generate payloads practically on every thinkable platform and architecture. Msfvenom can generate virtually any payload that we could possibly want while also supporting various obfuscation and encoding methods.
msfvenom --list platforms
msfvenom --list archs

How to know which exploit to use?   one little trick that we could use
	nmap -sV -oX exploits.xml dotinternetbd.com
searchsploit --nmap file.xml


Exploit are dangerous because of their seemingly cryptic and obscure nature.  Beware of unknown Binary Blob (Binary Large Object)
